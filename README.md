# hello-world
This is my first repository.
This article explores the source code management and collaboration system called Git and provides guidance on how to get the most value from Git. Git can be used as a local source code management system, and can also be used for collaboration across people and devices with a single central hub (called the origin, or sometimes the "remote origin").[1] The term for a collection of files in Git is a "repository", and all Git operations are performed within a repository. Many people host their repositories at places such as GitHub, [2] Bitbucket, and Amazon Web Services CodeCommit.[3] It is also possible to have a purely local Git repository (with no remote origin) or to host the remote origin on your own server.
